// Buy It Now after the auction (Nov 2026).
//
// When a reserve lot ends without meeting its reserve, the seller can offer it
// at a fixed price for 48 hours on the public Buy It Now page. Rules:
//   - the price must be at least 10% below the original reserve
//   - the price must be above the highest bid (otherwise the seller should
//     sell to the top bidder instead)
//   - the first buyer to confirm buys it; the normal sale process follows
//
// The seller can set the price in advance while the lot is upcoming or live
// (it then starts automatically if the reserve isn't met), or within
// START_WINDOW_HOURS after the auction ends. Each lot gets one 48-hour window.
