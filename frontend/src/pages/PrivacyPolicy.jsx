                                    sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both
                                    positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal
                                    data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data
                                    for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you
                                    (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to
                                    by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our
                                    legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of
                                    specific activities by contacting us.
